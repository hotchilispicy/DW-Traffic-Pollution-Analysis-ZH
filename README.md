# DW-Traffic-Pollution-Analysis-ZH
As already described in our project report, this project focuses on the analysis of the traffic and environmental impact in the city of Zurich.

# Execution of code
All functions contain LF or GLUE in the name already. This means:
LF = lambda function - to be executed in AWS driectly as a lambda function
GLUE = AWS Glue Pyspark - to be exectued in the AWS directly as a Glue ETL script

If there is no extention like the described above, the script is to be executed in python in a regular way.
